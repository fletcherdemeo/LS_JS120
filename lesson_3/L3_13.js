// Question 1
// What do we mean when we say that classes are first-class values?

// Classes similar to other first class values in JavaScript can be 
// passed around, including to and from functions, assigned to variables etc.

// Question 2
// Consider the following class declaration:

class Television {
  static manufacturer() {
    // omitted code
  }

  model() {
    // method logic
  }
}

// The static modifier creates a static method called manufacturer that
// is part of the Television constructor. This method would be invoked
// by calling Television.manufacturer().
